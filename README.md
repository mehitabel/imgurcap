imgurcap
========

transparently upload screenshots to imgur on os x

Usage: make sure imgur and imgurcap are executable and on the path. Calling imgurcap will prompt you to capture a selection of the screen, upload the image to imgur, delete the local copy, and open the imgur version in your browser. This is a brittle solution but it does exactly what I want to do.

Note: imgur is imgur-cli, which does much more. https://code.google.com/p/imgur-cli/

Apparently we've inherited GPLv3 from that dependency.
